# YouTube Clone Project

## Project Overview

This project is a development of a YouTube Clone, designed to replicate core functionalities of YouTube while introducing unique features to enhance user engagement and experience. The key features include:

1. **User Points System**: Users earn 5 points for each video watched, with points displayed in their profile.
2. **Custom Video Player**: A video player with gesture-based controls such as double-tap to skip, single-tap to pause, and multi-tap actions for navigation.
3. **VoIP Service**: A feature that allows video calls, screen sharing, and session recording, available from 6 PM to 12 AM.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB (for database setup)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KiruOP/Youtube-Clone.git
```

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

Navigate to the `server` folder and create a `.env` file to store environment variables. Use the `.env.example` file as a template:

```bash
cd youtube-clone/server
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in the required variables in the `.env` file, such as database connection strings and authentication credentials.

### Step 3: Install Node Modules

Next, install the required Node.js packages in both the `client` and `server` directories:

```bash
cd ../client
npm install

cd ../server
npm install
```

### Step 4: Run the Project

To start the project, open two terminal windows or tabs—one for the `client` and one for the `server`—and run the following command in each:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start both the frontend and backend servers.

### Step 5: Add Database

Ensure your MongoDB server is running. The application will connect to the database specified in the `.env` file. If needed, create a new database for this project and update the `.env` file with the appropriate connection string.

### Step 6: Add Authentication Client ID

To enable authentication features, provide a valid client ID. Add client ID to this path 
```bash
cd ../client/src/index.js
```

## Conclusion

This YouTube clone project demonstrates full-stack development skills, incorporating user engagement features, custom video controls, and a time-restricted VoIP service. Follow the steps above to set up the project on your local machine and explore its functionalities.
